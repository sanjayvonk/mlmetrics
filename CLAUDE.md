## Target audience

Graduate students in econometrics (MSc Econometrics & Management Science level). Assume:

- **Strong foundations**: probability theory, mathematical statistics, MLE, OLS/WLS/GLS, HAC standard errors, GARCH, AR/ARMA processes, basic panel data methods
- **No ML assumed**: never assume prior exposure to neural networks, tree-based methods, or ML-specific concepts like cross-validation or regularization
- **Frame ML via econometrics**: when introducing ML concepts, connect them to econometric analogues the students already know (e.g., "gradient boosting builds on the idea of iterative residual fitting, similar to how you'd think about sequential OLS on residuals")

---

## Content philosophy

1. **Econometric data, always.** Examples and applications use financial time series, macroeconomic forecasting, panel data, cross-sectional economic data. Never cats-and-dogs image classification or similar.
2. **Non-iid is the norm.** Time series dependence, heteroskedasticity, and structural breaks are recurring themes throughout. Standard iid assumptions should be questioned explicitly when they appear.
3. **Theory + implementation balance.** Each chapter has mathematical foundations and Python implementations, but theory should be self-contained enough to understand without running code.
4. **Notation and rigor.** Use precise mathematical notation. Define terms before using them. Proofs and derivations should be step-by-step.

## Exercise requirements

Exercises must be suitable for a **3-hour handwritten exam**:

- **Pen-and-paper gradeable**: every exercise must be answerable with pen and paper. No "run this code and report" questions.
- **Concrete, well-scoped sub-parts**: break exercises into numbered parts (Part 1, Part 2, ...) with clear, bounded scope. Each part should be independently gradeable.
- **No open-ended questions**: avoid "discuss the implications" or "what do you think about" style questions. Each part should have a definitive correct answer or derivation.
- **Gradual difficulty**: hints guide students through harder exercises; a strong student should be able to solve without hints, but hints make the exercise accessible to all.
- **Difficulty annotation**: include an italic comment about exam suitability, e.g., `*Could be part of an exam if broken into sub-exercises with hints.*`

### Difficulty calibration

Exercises should be calibrated for **MSc econometrics students with strong statistics/econometrics training**. The goal is not merely to check whether students recognize notation, but whether they can work through a statistically meaningful argument under exam conditions.

- **Target time per sub-part**: as a default, each numbered sub-part should take roughly **5-10 minutes** for a well-prepared student. If a sub-part can be answered in 30-60 seconds by copying a formula from the notes, it is too short unless it is only scaffolding for a harder follow-up part.
- **Statistical substance**: each exercise should contain reasonably difficult statistical content. Prefer derivations, comparisons of estimators or loss functions, conditional-vs-unconditional reasoning, misspecification analysis, dependence/non-iid issues, identification, or interpretation of formal results.
- **Not just interpretation**: interpretation questions are useful, but they should usually come **after** a nontrivial derivation or formal step. Do not let an exercise consist mainly of short conceptual prompts with no mathematical work.
- **Not just notation drills**: avoid exercises that only ask students to restate a definition, copy a likelihood, verify a trivial positivity/probability constraint, or substitute symbols into a formula already given in the text. Such tasks are acceptable only as a first part that prepares a deeper second or third part.
- **Econometric framing**: whenever possible, at least one sub-part should connect the ML object to an econometric issue such as forecast evaluation, dependent data, heteroskedasticity, information sets, leakage, misspecification, or identification.
- **Bounded but nontrivial**: the exercise should still be solvable with pen and paper in exam conditions. Avoid long proofs, excessive algebra with little insight, or questions that require ideas not developed in the notes.

### Default exercise mix

Unless the chapter genuinely does not support it, aim for exercises with this profile:

- **one derivation-oriented part** that requires real algebra or likelihood/scoring-rule manipulation
- **one comparison or implication part** that asks what changes across objectives, models, or assumptions
- **one econometric-diagnostic part** that surfaces a pitfall involving dependence, uncertainty, identification, or misspecification

### Final exercise self-check

Before keeping an exercise, check:

- Would a strong student need around **5-10 minutes** for each sub-part?
- Does at least one sub-part require a nontrivial statistical derivation or argument?
- Does the exercise go beyond formula recall?
- Would the solution reveal whether the student actually understands the chapter?

## Writing conventions

### Chapter structure

Each chapter follows this skeleton:

1. **YAML frontmatter**: `number-sections: true`, `number-offset: [N, 0]` (where N = chapter number - 1)
2. **`# Chapter Title`** (top-level heading)
3. **`## Overview`** — what the chapter covers and why it matters for econometricians
4. **`## Roadmap`** — numbered list previewing the section flow
5. **Core content sections** (`##`, `###`, `####`)
6. **`## Summary`** — contains a Key Takeaways callout (`callout-important`) and, when useful, a Common Pitfalls callout (`callout-warning`). Both live under this single heading.
7. **`## Exercises`** — pen-and-paper exercises with hints and solutions

### Summary section

- Each chapter has a single `## Summary` heading that contains one or two callout boxes.
- The **Key Takeaways** callout (`.callout-important` with `## Key Takeaways` title) always appears first, with a numbered list. It is styled green via `styles.css`.
- An optional **Common Pitfalls** callout (`.callout-warning` with `## Common Pitfalls` title) follows when there are predictable misunderstandings, implementation mistakes, or exam traps. Include it when useful, omit when it would be artificial.

### Callout types

| Type | Role | Collapsible? |
|------|------|-------------|
| `callout-note` | Key properties, notation, exercise statements | No |
| `callout-definition` | Formal mathematical definitions | No |
| `callout-example` | Worked examples | No |
| `callout-warning` | Exercise hints, cautions, common pitfalls | Usually yes (`collapse="true"`); no for chapter-level `Common Pitfalls` boxes |
| `callout-tip` | Exercise solutions, practical advice | Yes (`collapse="true"`) |
| `callout-important` | Critical econometric interpretations, "why this matters", boxed key takeaways | No |

### Code chunks

- Python is the primary language for code examples
- Display figures: `#| echo: false`, `#| label: fig-descriptive-name`, `#| fig-cap: "Caption"`
- Instructional code: `#| echo: true`
- Global settings: `code-fold: true` (readers click "Show the code"), `cache: true`

### Cross-references

- Section anchors: `# Title {#sec-shortname}`
- Reference sections: `@sec-shortname`, figures: `@fig-name`, citations: `@AuthorYear`

### Python stack

Core: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `sklearn`. Additional as needed: `pandas`, `properscoring`, `seaborn`. Don't add new dependencies without discussion.

- **Render**: `quarto render` (output to `docs/`)
- **Deploy**: manual SFTP upload
- **Bibliography**: `~/Dropbox (Personal)/library.bib`, style: `apalike`, rendered as hover citations/footnotes

## What NOT to do

- Don't change `_quarto.yml` structure or chapter ordering without discussion
- Don't create new chapter files without discussion
- Don't add Python dependencies beyond the core stack without asking
- Don't modify `styles.css` or the Quarto theme
- Don't write exercises that require running code to answer
- Don't use image classification examples (MNIST, CIFAR, cats vs dogs, etc.)
